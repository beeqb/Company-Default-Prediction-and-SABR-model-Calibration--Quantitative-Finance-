These two projects were done for a leading consulting firm's financial service division based in the UK. The first project required the application of machine learning to company data to predict their probability of default. The second project required the calibration of the SABR model on swaption volatility data.

The files in the project are as follows:

- Default Prediction.ipynb: The main script which looks at the default prediction.

- market_data.xlsx: The data file for the SABR model calibration project.

- SABR model calibration.ipynb: The main script which looks at SABR model calibration.
